For these past few months, Oakstop Alliance has supported Shield the Bay response efforts by hosting and serving as our PPE production and assembly site for all our face shields for healthcare workers. Not only have they generously shared their space with us, but they also share our values, which is critical to us in this partnership: The Oakstop Alliance supports groups \u0026ldquo;that confront and deconstruct the barriers of systematic oppression with actionable results\u0026rdquo;. Working closely together, we have assembled hundreds of face shields. Thanks to Oakstop Alliance Executive Director Damon Johnson for welcoming us in and embracing our movement.\nTo connect and learn more about Oakstop Alliance click here.\nFor further information contact Executive Director Damon Johnson: damon@oakstop.com\n",

    "body": "Sustained demand for various PPE will persist through mid 2020, roughly doubling as traditional health services are restored. In this environment, our goal is to catalyze a new marketplace, engaging various small local businesses in manufacturing our proven product design and connecting them with the procurement arms of healthcare systems. We will build lasting community resilience by helping Bay Area health systems to safely serve communities most in need while establishing an alternative means of producing high-quality PPE that supports local businesses.\nWe are a collaborative with deep professional expertise in healthcare, industrial and user-centered design, and health equity: private sector design-manufacturing partners COSMO and Newman Design; scientists, faculty and students from UC Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s Colleges of Chemistry, Public Health, and Engineering; and infection control and system logistics leadership at Bay Area county emergency response systems.\nYou can find out more and/or help support us towards our goal at this gofundme.\nA huge huge thank you to all of our friends and family who have supported us towards this goal.\n",

    "body": "1. How is this effort different from the other PPE efforts I have seen?\nIn working with public and less-served institutions, equity is critical to our mission. Our health care providers need many types of PPE. We are producing and distributing face shields - an important part of the solution that can be cost effectively sourced by our partners. The visors can be reused, and the plastic shield is cost effective and easily replaceable. We are a team of professionals with deep domain expertise: private sector design-manufacturing partners COSMO and Newman Design; faculty from UC Berkeley’s College of Chemistry and School of Public Health; a scientist from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory independently volunteering her time; and an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley. We are working directly with the heads of infection control, system logistics, and firstline responders at Bay Area county hospitals (for example the Alameda Health System) and emergency response systems to ensure maximum usability of our designs. We actively incorporate the feedback of healthcare providers, which helps us ensure that hospitals can accept our donations.\n2. What are we buying and where are we sourcing from? Having adapted UCSF’s standardized open source face shield design, we are buying parts and materials including: 3D printed visors, plastic shields, foam, and elastic bands. These components are readily available through standard commercial supply channels. We’ve made our own adjustments to ensure the final product fits the specifications of different healthcare providers.\n3. What is the cost? Roughly every 2 dollars you donate will enable us to fabricate a face shield. That means that $20 makes 10 shields, and $50 dollars gives the healthcare providers in the Bay Area another 25 shields. We have a mix of contributors, with different cost recovery needs. We’ll keep you updated.\n4. Who specifically are we donating to? We are working directly with the heads of infection control, system logistics, and firstline responders at Bay Area county hospitals (for example Alameda Health System) and emergency response systems to ensure maximum usability of our designs. We actively incorporate the feedback of healthcare providers, to ensure that our donations are put immediately to use. Equity is critical to our mission. We have partners whose need is confirmed and suppliers who can meet that need. We\u0026rsquo;ll be starting with donations to Highland Hospital in Oakland, then scaling our efforts from there.\n5. What does the demonstrated need look like? Our recipients are currently using hundreds to thousands of shields each day for their healthcare professionals to stay safely protected. With your support we can make a tangible impact.\n",

A team of designers and students, including Assistant Professor of Chemistry Michael Zuerch and members of his lab, have joined Shield the Bay to produce and distribute face shields to hospitals and emergency response systems in order to meet healthcare professionals’ needs on the frontlines of COVID-19. The project\u0026rsquo;s focus is to make masks for public institutions that are located in and serving communities of color. Equity is critical to the project\u0026rsquo;s mission.\nPhoto: Asst. Professor Michael Zuerch demonstrates the new mask design\n“Our approach is founded on the idea that we need to quickly deliver a product, at scale, that healthcare systems will be willing to use now,” says Jaspal Sandhu, an assistant adjunct professor at Berkeley Public Health and a member of the Shield the Bay team.\nSandhu is an expert in human-centered design. The project is utilizing his design approach to fabricate face shields for healthcare professionals. By definition, human-centered design puts the user’s perspective into all steps of the design process. Shield the Bay has relied on the perspective of frontline healthcare workers to make this product work in the most critical clinical environments.\nIn early April, the team produced and delivered prototypes to Highland Hospital in Oakland. The shields were trialed by nurses, who gave feedback on the size, durability, comfort, and other aspects of the face shields to help improve the design.\n“Very rarely are healthcare workers asked for their input. We love this opportunity!” one recipient commented in a post-trial survey.\nNursing staff from Highland Hospital greet staff\nThe project is currently raising money through a GoFundMe(link is external) page to pay for materials. The team is continuing to fabricate face shields with help from recipient input, and scaling up production. Healthcare professionals in the Bay Area are using tens of thousands of shields each day to stay safely protected. The project is currently being run entirely by the efforts of a team of volunteers. Every $50 donation provides materials to make shields for 100 patient encounters.\nIn addition to Jaspal Sandhu, the Shield the Bay team includes human-centered product design experts Catherine Newman, Jessica Granderson of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Sean Miller of COSMO; assistant professor of chemistry Michael Zuerch and his graduate students; undergraduate student Gillian Chu and a growing team of student volunteers.\nFor more information, visit the GoFundMe page(link is external) for Shield the Bay and contribute to the effort to provide healthcare professionals with the safety tools they need.\n",

They have delivered over 2500 shields to Highland Hospital, and built up a great relationship with the logistics, infection control, and nursing teams. By all counts their design is preferred and offers several advantages over other donated PPE that may not really end up getting used by nurses in the higher risk contexts.\n",
